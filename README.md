_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
## What Exactly is Blockchain?
- Blockchain is a **tamper-proof distributed digital ledger**.
- This digital ledger is safe, secure, transparent, and decentralized, which simply means that it is not controlled by a single authority.
- It is like a ledger that a bank uses to keep track of all customer transactions. However, in a bank, the ledger is controlled by the bank, and only the bank can see the transactions.
- Whereas in blockchain, there is no central authority, and the ledger runs on multiple computers and doesn’t require any single person to authenticate or settle transactions.
- Blockchain is an unchangeable digital ledger that is collectively shared, enabling the seamless recording of transactions and monitoring of assets within a network.
- Assets can encompass both **tangible items** like houses, cars, cash, and land, as well as **intangible entities** such as intellectual property, patents, copyrights, and branding.
- Virtually any valuable item can be traced and exchanged on a blockchain network, leading to decreased risks and reduced expenses for all participants involved.



## What is a blockchain node?
Blockchains consist of a group of computers known as nodes. These nodes work together to synchronize the blockchain’s data, handle transaction requests, and reach consensus on the validity of those transactions.

#### Typea of Blockchian Nodes?







## What is a Block?
- With each data transaction taking place, it is documented and stored as a data block. These blocks form a chain of data.
- Blocks are arranged in a specific order, with new blocks added at the end of the chain.
- Each block includes a ***unique identifier called a hash***, which references the previous block. This is an important security feature of blockchain technology that makes it incredibly difficult to tamper with the ledger.
- In addition to important information like the time of the transaction and the record itself, every block contains the solution to a special puzzle that requires computational power to solve.

#### Types of Block
**1. Genesis Block-->** The very first block is the genesis block. Unlike other blocks, it doesn’t have a reference to a previous block because it marks the beginning of the chain.

**2. -->**
**3. -->**




## Structure of Blockchain




## What is Smart Contract?
- Smart contracts are **computer programs** that automatically carry out predefined parameters.
- The terms are coded directly into the program’s lines. This program is stored on a decentralized blockchain network.
- When specific conditions outlined in the code are met, the smart contract is executed automatically. Once the code is run, it cannot be undone or modified.
- Smart contracts offer a major benefit by allowing transactions and agreements to happen between parties who may not fully trust each other. This means that there’s no need for a third-party authority, legal system, or external mechanism to oversee the process. It allows for anonymous execution of agreements.






## What is a Decentralised Application(dApp)?
Smart contracts, or also called as Decentralized Applications (DApps) are applications that operate on a distributed computing system, specifically a blockchain network, rather than relying on a single server.
- When defining a DApp, they are typically characterized by being Open Source, Decentralized, and Cryptographically secure.
- DApps consist of two important components: the **frontend and the backend**.
- **The frontend is responsible for user interaction, while the backend is essentially a smart contract.**

#### Advantage of DApps
The main advantage of choosing a DApp over a traditional app is that traditional apps use a centralized architecture, where data is stored on servers controlled by a single entity. This centralized setup has a single point of failure, making it vulnerable to technical issues and malicious attacks. On the other hand, DApps offer similar quality of service as regular apps while benefiting from decentralization, including high uptime and resistance to censorship and corruption.

#### Types of DApps (Decentralised Application)

##### 1. DeFi (Decentralised Finance)





####  Who are the key Stakeholders of a Blockchain?
The different parts of a blockchain can be categorized into distinct layers, with each layer involving various stakeholders.
1. **Protocol Layer -->** At the protocol layer, we have Developers, Researchers, and academia.
   - Developers have the task of designing and improving blockchain protocols, designing the architecture of blockchain systems, and possessing expertise in data structures and cryptography.
   - Researchers play a crucial role in educating others about blockchain technology’s impact and exploring its wide-ranging applications in business and society.
  
3. **Networking Layer -->** The networking layer involves stakeholders like Miners, Validatos, Industry bodies, and Traders.
   - Miners contribute to public blockchains like Bitcoin by building consensus among untrusted nodes. They add transactions to the network by solving complex mathematical problems, requiring substantial computing power and electricity.
   - Industry bodies act as intermediaries between researchers, private entities, and public institutions, advocating for blockchain technology and establishing standards.
   - Traders are entities that rely on cryptocurrencies rather than traditional fiat currency, allowing others access to blockchain protocols through cryptocurrency tokens.

3. ** Application Layer -->** The application layer encompasses entrepreneurs, end-users, corporations, and venture capitalists or investors.
   - *Entrepreneurs* develop applications, products, or services that make use of blockchain protocols and networks. While profitability is a common goal for entrepreneurs, those in the blockchain space often have an anti-establishment approach and a lack of trust in traditional systems.
   - *End-users* are individuals who utilize blockchain applications, products, or services, and their preferences greatly influence the decision-making of other stakeholders.
   - *Corporations* aim to solve business problems and develop new strategies using blockchain technology, recognizing its value in areas like trust, transparency, data security, sustainability, and ethical sourcing.
   - *Venture capitalists or investors* provide capital to establish the blockchain infrastructure. They have opportunities to invest in blockchain protocols directly or support companies that provide essential services and infrastructure for the blockchain ecosystem


## Use Case of Blockchain
- In addition to its growing adoption in established industries such as Government and Public Sector, Manufacturing, Supply Chain, or Healthcare, blockchain technology has also given rise to several new industries and use cases. 
- These include cryptocurrency, NFT (Non-fungible token), DeFi (Decentralized Finance), DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), and the Metaverse.



## What is a Private Blockchain?
- A private blockchain or permissioned blockchain is a type of blockchain or distributed ledger that operates within a closed network controlled by a single entity or a closed group.
- A private blockchain restricts access to only authorized participants. This means that new participants must go through a verification process to join the network, and the participation in the consensus process is limited to certain individuals.
- Private blockchains are typically used within the internal network of an enterprise. They are designed for the specific needs of the organization and rely on trust among the employees or partners within that organization. Unlike public blockchains that are decentralized, a private blockchain is centralized because it is controlled by a single entity or a closed group.


## What is a Public Blockchain?
- A public blockchain, also referred to as permissionless blockchain, is a global and open network that operates in a decentralized manner. It allows anyone to participate in transactions, contribute to the consensus protocol, and review the contents of the blockchain.
- One major benefit of a public blockchain is its **transparency**. Since anyone can join the network, it offers greater visibility into transactions and operations compared to private networks.
- It is also **more decentralized** because no single entity has complete control over the entire system. This decentralization helps ensure the integrity and security of the blockchain.
- Public blockchains can face challenges in terms of **transaction speeds and scalability**. Due to their openness and the involvement of a large number of participants, **processing transactions can take longer, and the network may struggle to handle a high volume of transactions**.
- Despite these challenges, **public blockchains are resistant to censorship and external interference**. Because there is **no single point of failure or control**, it becomes difficult for any individual or entity to manipulate or disrupt the blockchain. This attribute enhances the trustworthiness and reliability of the system.


## What is a Hybrid Blockchain?
- A hybrid blockchain is a special type of blockchain that combines features from both public and private blockchains. It brings together the best of the two blockchain types to form a unique system.
- Most blockchains are either public or private. There is currently a lack of hybrid blockchain solutions, which is a must for facilitating enterprise mass adoption.
- In a hybrid blockchain, enterprises can decide which data (transaction) shall be posted from private blockchain to public blockchain. This flexibility allows them to control who can access specific data on the blockchain and decide which data should be made public.



## Layer-1 Blockchain
- A Layer-1 blockchain platform is the **basic infrastructure of all blockchain projects and applications**. It is like the operating system on a computer. The **whole ecosystem can only build and work on top of it**.
- A Layer-1 blockchain is the **fundamental building block of a blockchain network**. It serves as the underlying protocol that forms the basis of the entire system. The primary purpose is to **securely record transactions** on a public ledger that cannot be modified or tampered with.
- Layer-1 blockchains are considered the most basic form of blockchain technology. They are often called the **“core”** or **“foundation”** of the network because they **provide the necessary infrastructure for other applications and protocols to operate**. They play a crucial role in maintaining the distributed ledger, validating transactions, and protecting the network from any harmful activities.
- In simpler terms, a Layer-1 blockchain is like the solid ground on which the entire blockchain network stands. It ensures that transactions are recorded accurately and securely, allowing other layers and applications to function effectively on top of it.


## Layer-2 Blockchain
- In simpler terms, Layer-2 networks are like an **extra layer built on top of an existing blockchain system**. They help increase transaction speed and capacity without needing to make significant changes to the main blockchain. The result is a more efficient and scalable blockchain network overall.
- A Layer-2 network is a secondary protocol that is built on an existing Layer-1 blockchain system. **Its main purpose is to enhance the scalability of the underlying blockchain by handling a large number of transactions quickly**.
- Popular blockchains like Ethereum have become increasingly popular due to their programmability and resistance to censorship, which allows for a wide range of products and use cases to be developed on them. However, Ethereum can only process a limited number of transactions per second, leading to congestion and high transaction fees.
- Layer-2 protocols serve as a solution to this problem by creating an additional framework where transactions and processes can occur independently from the main blockchain. These protocols are often referred to as ***“off-chain”*** scaling solutions. They offer several benefits, including increased transaction throughput and reduced costs.
- By offloading a significant portion of the workload to the second layer, the main chain can focus on providing security while the second layer achieves high transaction speeds. This means that hundreds or even thousands of transactions per second can be processed without compromising the network’s security.

                                                                   # EVERYTHING ABOUT BLOCKCHAIN WALLET



## Blockchain Wallet
- A blockchain wallet represents a vital tool in the realm of cryptocurrency, **serving as a secure and anonymous digital wallet** that empowers users to effectively manage diverse forms of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, or QANX.
- Its core purpose lies in **facilitating seamless fund exchanges**, ensuring both convenience and security. The **cryptographic signatures employed in transactions guarantee the integrity and protection of each transaction**. Accessible via web devices, including mobile platforms, this wallet upholds user privacy and identity confidentiality. By encompassing these essential features, a blockchain wallet establishes a robust framework for executing secure and trustworthy transfers and exchanges of funds among various parties.
- The blockchain wallet itself can manifest in different forms, including internet-connected **“hot wallets” like MetaMask**, or **offline “airgapped”** hardware wallets.
- From a technical standpoint, it is pertinent to view the wallet as the client responsible for managing the functionality, as opposed to being solely reliant on storing cryptographic keys.
- In common practice, individuals frequently employ the term “wallet” to encompass their overall cryptocurrency portfolio, the associated accounts derived from it, or even an individual account.


## Security of your Blockchain Wallet
- By adhering to simple yet effective best practices, you can elevate the security of your crypto wallet and fortify the protection of your holdings. Some recommended measures include safeguarding your seed phrase, opting for cold wallets, utilizing multiple addresses, and exercising caution when dealing with tokens received through airdrops.
- It is crucial to ensure the secure setup of your wallet.
- Activating two-factor authentication (2FA) to your exchange account adds always an extra layer of protection.
- By setting up your self-custodial wallet you can mitigate the risk of future hacks by using a freshly installed computer which was never connected to the internet before.
- It is advisable to set up a **hardware wallet**. Hardware wallets are physical devices designed explicitly for storing cryptocurrencies securely offline. They are considered the most reliable type of crypto wallet.
- It is recommended to use a unique and strong password specifically for your wallet to enhance security. When using a browser-extension wallet such as **MetaMask wallet**, it is important to note that the wallet may prompt you for your password frequently.
- Accessing a wallet necessitates the provision of a unique and confidential 12-24-word seed phrase. The loss of this seed phrase results in the irretrievable loss of wallet access and the inability to recover your assets.
- Your password and seed phrase remains unknown to any other individual, as anyone possessing it can gain unrestricted access to and control over your assets. Never share your seed phrase or your private keys with anyone!.
- It is essential to exercise caution and refrain from engaging with randomly received tokens in your wallet address.



## Address
- ***A wallet address, which is also called as crypto address or blockchain address is a special combination of characters that acts as a representation of a wallet used to receive, store, send cryptocurrency. It’s like a real-life address, bank account, or an email address.***
- Bitcoin addresses mostly start with a “1” or “3” and are typically 26–35 alphanumeric characters long. Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain addresses start with “0x,” followed by a string of 40 hexadecimal characters.
- Addresses are created using a private key, which is also unique to the address. The digital assets held by the address can be accessed with the private key. Never share your private key with anyone!
- Blockchain addresses are public and often called “public keys”. By using a blockchain explorer, you have the ability to observe the transactions linked to an address and check the number of assets it holds.
- The person who owns an address usually doesn’t have their real name connected to it, and setting up a new wallet address on the blockchain doesn’t require any personally identifiable information.


## Public and Private Keys
- ***Public-key cryptography relies on two essential components: public keys and private keys, which function as its operational elements. Jointly, they facilitate the encryption and decryption processes for data circulating within a network. While the public key is openly accessible and can be distributed without limitations, it is crucial to safeguard the private key, ensuring exclusive knowledge limited to its rightful owner.***
- A public key is a unique combination of letters and numbers used to encrypt messages into a secure form called **ciphertext**. It enables peer-to-peer **transactions without revealing private key details**, ensuring a safe exchange of assets and information without involving a third party.
- When engaging in a transaction, a user shares their public key with the other party. They can make this key public for everyone to see.
- Private keys, are secret keys used to access cryptocurrency funds. They correspond to specific public keys and are generated together using advanced encryption algorithms. This ensures that knowing someone’s public key doesn’t allow anyone to figure out their private key.
- A private key is like a password or access code associated with a crypto wallet address. It encrypts transactions to prevent unauthorized access to assets.
- In contrast, a public key decrypts the private key to authorize access. In the world of cryptocurrency, a public key is used to receive tokens, while a private key proves ownership of those tokens.
- A private key enables the **digital signing of data**, such as a message indicating a payment from one address to another. In essence, a **transaction** is a **signed statement on the blockchain** that assigns coins to a new address.



## Seed Phrase
- ***The seed phrase, which is also called a "key phrase, recovery phrase or mnemonic phrase", consists of a sequence of 12 to 24 words created by your cryptocurrency wallet. It acts as a "master password", granting access to the crypto linked to that wallet. Imagine the wallet as a password manager for your cryptocurrencies and the seed phrase as the ultimate key.***
- As long as you possess your seed phrase, you can access all the crypto associated with the wallet, even if you lose or delete the wallet itself.
- The seed phrase is created by the wallet’s software using a random set of words obtained from the private key of the wallet. The same set of words in the same order always generate the same number. It’s essential to keep a secure record of the seed phrase. If the user loses access to their wallet, the seed phrase can be entered into any **BIP39-compatible wallet** to recover the funds.
-  Seed phrases are not specific to any particular cryptocurrency. The same seed phrase can be used across numerous wallets, enabling the user to recover an entire portfolio of coins and tokens using a single seed phrase. Most popular wallets offer the option to recover funds using a seed phrase as long as it has been accurately recorded.



## Types of Blockchain Wallet
Blockchain wallets can be classified into two distinct categories: **Custodial or Self-custodial wallets**, and further categorized as **Hardware or Software wallets**.

- **Custodial wallets**, like centralized exchanges, do not provide users with direct access to their private keys. Instead, a **trusted third-party securely manages and protects the seed phrase on behalf of the user**.
- **Self-custodial wallets** grant users **full control over their private keys**. When setting up such a wallet, you will be provided with your seed phrase. Once you unlock a self-custodial wallet, you have complete ownership and control over your cryptocurrency.
- **Cold wallets** are offline **Physical hardware wallets**. They offer the highest level of security when it comes to storing cryptocurrencies. Some hardware wallets can be connected to the internet through physical or software means, while others are “air-gapped,” meaning they receive transaction requests and provide approvals through methods like QR codes.
- **Hot wallets**, or so called **Software wallets** are digital wallets connected to the internet. They are less secure than cold wallets because they are vulnerable to hacking.
  - **Web wallets** can be accessed through a web browser. They offer convenience, but they can be riskier since the management of private keys is often entrusted to third parties.
  - **Desktop wallets** are "software programs". They need to be downloaded and run on the user’s computer. They are less convenient than web wallets but offer more security because the private keys are stored locally and managed by the users themselves. It is important to use desktop wallets only on clean computers without any virus or malware infections.
  - **Mobile wallets** share similarities with desktop wallets in terms of functionality and purpose, but they are specifically designed for the use on smartphones. They utilize QR codes, making it easy to send and receive cryptocurrencies.





## Exchange Wallet
- The primary distinction between a self-custodial cryptocurrency wallet and an exchange wallet lies in the management of private keys.
- **“Not your keys, not your coins” is a popular expression in the world of blockchain. In exchange wallets, like those provided by **centralized exchanges (CEXs)**, the exchange has control over your private keys, similar to how banks hold your funds. With a self-custodial wallet, you have full control and ownership of your private keys.**
- When you make a purchase on a centralized cryptocurrency exchange, the acquired cryptocurrency is typically stored in the exchange’s wallet, which is both custodial and in most cases also “hot.” This means the exchange holds your private keys, and the wallet is connected to the internet. It is crucial to trust the exchange you use to safeguard your crypto in such cases.
- Exchange wallets are often considered less secure compared to self-custodial wallets. With an exchange wallet, you must trust the centralized exchange (CEX) to protect your funds. Additionally, since exchanges hold a large amount of digital assets, they become attractive targets for hackers.


 
## How to check the balance of your wallet address?
- If you use a custodial wallet, such as an exchange wallet, you can conveniently access your account balance by visiting the exchange’s website. If you use a self-custodial wallet, you can check the balance of your address on a blockchain explorer or in your wallet.
- Since blockchain addresses are public, the easiest way to check the balance of your wallet address — if you don’t store your cryptocurrency on a centralized exchange — is to copy and paste your wallet address into a blockchain explorer.
- If you have **ERC-20 tokens** (tokens on the Ethereum network), you shall use **etherscan.io**. If you have **BEP-20 tokens** (tokens on the Binance Smart Chain), you shall use **bscscan.com** to view your balance.
- In addition, you can also review your holdings within your hardware or software wallet.

                                                              # Coins and Tokens Types
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                              
## Coin 
- Coins are native cryptocurrencies that operate on their own dedicated blockchains, functioning independently from other cryptocurrencies, blockchains, or platforms. Examples of coins include ETH (Ethereum), BTC (Bitcoin), and BNB (Binance Smart Chain).
- Coins primarily function as a medium of exchange and store of value. They are designed to be used as digital currencies for transactions and may have broader acceptance as a form of payment.
- Native coins are essential for the functioning of their respective blockchain networks. Native coins are used to pay for transaction fees, facilitate transactions, and incentivize network participants. Just as fuel powers a car’s engine, native coins power the operations and activities within a blockchain ecosystem.



## Token
- Tokens encompass a broader category that includes various digital assets within specific platforms. Tokens are typically built and operate on existing blockchain platforms like Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain, utilizing their infrastructure, protocols, and standards.
- Although the terms “token” and “coin” are frequently used interchangeably within the cryptocurrency realm, they possess separate definitions that can vary depending on the context.
- Remember, to engage in transactions involving tokens issued on a particular blockchain, it is necessary to possess the native cryptocurrency (coin) of that blockchain. This requirement arises because transaction fees, which are incurred when conducting transactions, must be paid using the native coin of the blockchain.
- Tokens often adhere to specific token standards defined by the blockchain platform they are built on, providing guidelines for their functionality and interoperability.
- Popular token standards or protocols on the Ethereum blockchain are for example **ERC-20** (most widely adopted token standard for fungible tokens), **ERC-721** (*token standard for NFTs*), **ERC-1155** (hybrid token standard for fungible and non-fungible tokens within the same smart contract).



## Tokens Types
- Tokens are primarily classified based on their functionality. The two primary categories are **utility tokens** and **security tokens**.
- Tokens can also be classified based on their features as either fungible or non-fungible.
- **Fungible tokens**, similar to dollar bills, can be exchanged with other tokens of the same value without any distinction. Each unit holds the same purpose.
- **Non-fungible tokens**, like unique pieces of art, have distinct properties, and each unit must be treated separately.


## Utility Token
- **The primary purpose of utility tokens is to enable users to access and utilize specific features, products, or services offered by a blockchain-based platform or application. Utility tokens are created on a blockchain and are specific to the platform they are used on.**
- Utility tokens frequently function as a **medium of exchange or transaction within the platform**, enabling users to make payments for goods, services, or access privileges. They encompass a range of functionalities, including but not limited to:
  1. payment for services or transactions within the platform’s ecosystem,
  1. access to restricted areas, premium content, or exclusive features within a platform,
  1. interact with decentralized applications (dApps) or access specific functionalities like voting, staking, or participating in governance mechanisms,
  1. loyalty rewards, incentivizing users to engage with a platform by offering benefits, discounts, or bonuses, etc.
- Utility tokens are primarily designed for functional purposes, their value can still be subject to changes based on the dynamics of supply and demand.
- Utility tokens are generally not promoted or sold as investment opportunities since they do not represent ownership or provide profit-sharing rights in the same manner as security tokens.


## Security Token
- ** A security token is a digital form of traditional securities, including equities, debt, or a hybrid of both. Examples of traditional securities include stocks, bonds, ETFs, options, and futures. These securities can be tokenized to become security tokens, allowing them to be traded digitally.**
- Security tokens are **financial assets** that mirror the characteristics of traditional securities. For instance, during an **Initial Coin Offering (ICO)**, a company could issue tokenized shares that provide ownership rights and dividends to the holders. Legally, these tokenized shares are equivalent to traditionally-distributed shares.
- Individuals who own security tokens can benefit from the token’s performance and may also receive dividends in the form of additional tokens. They may also enjoy other advantages, such as voting power. In this way, security token holders can enjoy similar benefits to those provided by stocks and other securities.


## Stablecoin
- Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to retain a consistent value over time, **typically linked to prominent *fiat currencies*** such as the U.S. dollar, a collection of fiat currencies, or even valuable commodities like precious metals. The purpose of stablecoins is to minimize price volatility so their value doesn’t fluctuate significantly.
- These coins are backed by an underlying asset, typically the one they represent digitally, in order to maintain a stable price similar to traditional fiat currencies.
- There are four main types of stablecoins:
  1. ***Fiat-collateralized stablecoins***, such as **USDT, USDC, and BUSD**, which are backed by reserves of fiat currency.
  2. ***Commodity-collateralized stablecoins***, like **DigixGlobal**, which are backed by commodities like gold.
  3. ***Crypto-collateralized stablecoins***, such as **MakerDAO’s Dai token**, which are *backed by other cryptocurrencies*.
  4. ***Non-collateralized stablecoins***, which use algorithms to control the token supply and maintain a fixed price. These coins adjust their circulating supply based on market conditions.

 
     
## Asset-Backed token
- **Asset-backed tokens are digital tokens that serve as representations of real-world assets such as gold, crude oil, real estate, equity, and soybeans. The value of these tokens is directly linked to the value of the underlying physical asset they represent. These tokens are typically classified as securities by financial regulators.**
- Asset-backed tokens provide an alternative financial option that combines digital liquidity with the value of tangible assets, offering a solution to problems caused by unstable currencies or unpredictable stock markets. They enable investors to store value independent of traditional fiat currencies that are prone to inflation.
- When you own an asset-backed token, it means you have a claim on the corresponding physical asset.The tokens allow for the transfer of ownership without the need to physically move the assets, making transactions more efficient and cost-effective.
- Businesses can use asset-backed tokens to raise capital by offering them as equity instruments, following financial regulations. Alternatively, existing assets can be tokenized and sold to individual investors, offering them the opportunity to invest in real-world assets without the hassle of physical storage or exchange. This reduces trade friction and logistics costs.



## Governance Token
- **Governance tokens are tokens specifically designed by developers to enable token holders to actively contribute to the development and decision-making processes of a protocol or project. Organizations that embrace user control are often referred to as decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).**
- In the context of DAOs and decentralized finance (DeFi), governance tokens provide a more fair, decentralized, and transparent approach to governance. These systems utilize smart contracts to execute actions based on predefined conditions, creating trustless environments for transactions and information sharing. Through governance tokens, members of DAOs and DeFis can have an equal say in the decision-making process.
- Some governance tokens focus on voting for specific governance issues, while others cover a broader range of decisions.


## Non-Fungible Token (NFT)
- **A Non-Fungible Token (NFT) is a virtual token that provides verifiable proof of authenticity and ownership of a specific asset using cryptography.**
- NFTs are primarily recognized for their association with virtual art pieces, but their utility extends beyond that. NFTs can be used to represent a wide range of assets, including: real estate, domain name, event ticket, intellectual property, luxury watches, etc.
- Tokens can be unique and not interchangeable, especially when they represent digital proof of ownership of assets.
- An NFT is a virtual token that provides verifiable proof of authenticity and ownership of an asset using cryptography. For instance, if you own a virtual piece of art, you can create an NFT to tokenize that artwork, and the NFT will reflect your ownership of the unique artwork. The NFT is stored on the blockchain as proof of your ownership.



## Fake Token
- Similar to the existence of replica luxury watches or bags, the cryptocurrency market also has its share of counterfeit tokens.
- Scammers create fake tokens that look similar to popular ones, tricking users who are unaware of such scams.



## Testnet Token
- **Testnets are available for every available blockchain platform, providing a trial version for testing purposes. As the name implies, testnet tokens are a unique form of cryptocurrency that is specifically created for the purpose of testing.**
- Testnet tokens are used to try out new features and functionalities without risking tokens with real value. They provide a safe way to learn about blockchain technology without the fear of losing actual funds.
- It’s important to note that testnet tokens have no real value. They are solely intended for testing and development purposes, not for actual transactions. Tokens created on testnets cannot be exchanged for their equivalent value on the main network.


### How to get Testnet Token?
- Testnet tokens can be obtained at no cost through dedicated online faucets designed for each testnet. Simply provide your preferred wallet address, and within minutes, the testnet token will be deposited into your designated wallet address.
- As a first step, it is indeed recommended to generate a new address in your self-custodial wallet (or even a new wallet on a separate device), such as MetaMask, specifically for testing purposes. Creating a separate address for testing helps maintain the separation between your actual funds and any tokens or transactions used during testing.
- The next step is to obtain testnet tokens. You can either mine testnet tokens or request them from testnet faucets. These faucets are online services established by individuals or organizations that have spare testnet coins.
- Example: You can acquire testnet ETH for the Ethereum Testnet called Goerli. Nevertheless, there exist numerous alternative methods to obtain testnet tokens.
- After obtaining your testnet address and tokens, you can begin making transactions. Ensuring the use of the appropriate network when sending and receiving tokens is crucial.
- Utilize the testnet network: Now that you have your testnet wallet and tokens, you can start utilizing the testnet. This provides you with the opportunity to explore and test new features and applications before implementing them on the main network.

                                                         # BLOCKCHAIN TRANSACTION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


## Centralised Exchange (CEX)
- ***Centralized Exchanges (CEXs) e.g. Binance or Coinbase are platforms very similar to traditional trading platforms — e.g. eToro or Robinhood — that facilitate trades between users by maintaining an order book containing buy and sell orders from individual traders. These orders are requests made by individuals to buy or sell a certain amount of cryptocurrency at a specific price. CEXs gather and combine these orders from users, utilizing specialized software to match and complete the corresponding buy and sell transactions.***
- In Centralized Exchanges (CEXs), users don’t directly exchange cryptocurrencies or fiat currencies with each other. Instead, when users deposit funds onto an exchange, the exchange takes custody of those assets and provides users with **IOUs (I Owe You)** in return. These IOUs represent the ownership of the assets within the exchange’s system and are internally tracked as they change hands in trades. The conversion into actual currency or cryptocurrency occurs when users withdraw their funds from the exchange.
- It’s important to note that although centralized exchanges provide a service for buying, selling, and trading digital assets, they deviate from the principles of decentralization. These exchanges are operated by specific companies and retain custody of users’ funds.
- In exchange wallets, like those provided by centralized exchanges (CEXs), the exchange has control over your private keys, similar to how banks hold your funds. As a result, some users may prefer decentralized exchanges, which allow them to have complete control over their digital assets and transaction data.



## Decentralised Exchanged
- **Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) e.g. Uniswap or PancakeSwap are platforms where cryptocurrencies are exchanged using functionality programmed on the blockchain, particularly in smart contracts. Trading on DEXs occurs directly between users or liquidity pools, unlike centralized exchanges that resemble banks or investment firms specialized in cryptocurrencies.**
- When trading cryptocurrency, people typically rely on centralized exchanges (CEXs). These exchanges match buyers with sellers, similar to how securities exchanges operate.
- However, there are perceived downsides associated with traditional centralized exchanges. Firstly, these platforms are privately owned, which means there’s a third party involved in every transaction. These private companies have control over the transactions and collect customer information, which challenges the idea of cryptocurrency’s potential for anonymity.
- Transactions on centralized exchanges are custodial, meaning the exchange holds the assets being traded. Decentralized exchanges address these issues by offering greater anonymity and non-custodial transactions. This means that assets are never held by an intermediary during the exchange process.
- DEX platforms eliminate the need for intermediaries and conduct trades within a trustless automated environment based on smart contracts. While decentralized exchanges are less susceptible to cyber-attacks and infrastructure downtime, they cannot provide services involving fiat currency, such as fiat/crypto trading or fiat withdrawals/deposits.




## Transaction(tx)
- **A cryptocurrency transaction (tx) refers to the process of transferring or swapping (trading) cryptocurrencies within a blockchain. During a transaction, the details are recorded on the blockchain.**
- Cryptography is used to **encrypt the transaction data and the ledger**, ensuring its security. Unlike traditional fiat money, crypto transactions are decentralized, meaning they are **not regulated or controlled by a central bank or authority**.
- Peers engage in transactions using crypto wallets, where the sender transfers funds from their public address to another account.
- **To complete a transaction, the private key is required. Multiple transactions are grouped together into blocks and added to the blockchain. This task is typically performed by miners or validators**.
- The time it takes for a transaction to be recorded on the blockchain can vary depending on the network and the transaction fee paid. Transactions can be instant or take a few minutes to process. To check the status of a transaction, one can use the **block explorer of the specific cryptocurrency**.

###### What's happening in the background during a transaction on a blockchain
The transaction process can be divided into six steps:
1. A request for a transaction is made involving cryptocurrencies, contracts, records, or other information.
2. The **transaction is broadcasted** to all participating computers in the blockchain network, known as nodes. It is then considered “pending” and stored in the memory pool (Mem-pool).
3. Miners/validators verify the transaction by checking it against validation rules set by the creators of the blockchain network.
4. Validated transactions are stored in a block and **sealed with a lock called the hash**.
5. The new block is added to the existing blockchain, and other computers in the network validate the correctness of the block’s lock.
6. The transaction is complete, and it becomes a permanent part of the blockchain, unable to be altered.



## Transaction Hash(TxHash) / transaction ID (TxID)
- **A transaction hash (TxHash) or also known as transaction ID (TxID) is a special number assigned to each transaction that happens on a blockchain, which helps to uniquely identify and track that specific transaction**.
- The transaction hash consists of a string of letters and numbers.Example of a transaction hash (TxHash): 0x2cebc154c6c107116a77646ca23d23de86379fb0f6983695463336080f3f9476
- It acts as a special code that **uniquely identifies the transaction**. **With a transaction hash, you can retrieve information about the transaction, such as the amount of tokens sent, the amount payed for the transaction, the date of the transfer, the sender and recipient addresses, and the number of confirmations on the blockchain**.

##### Steps to find the Hash of the Transaction 
1. Open the cryptocurrency wallet.
2. In the list of completed (if you have any), locate the transaction you are interested in.
3. Click on the transaction hash (TxHash) / transaction ID (TxID).
4. You will see the transaction hash (TxHash) / transaction ID (TxID) along with all the details of the transaction.
5. Open a dedicated block explorer like *etherscan.com or bscscan.com* to check the status of the transaction by entering the TxHash.



## Block Explorer
- **Block explorer, also known as blockchain explorer, is a *graphical user interface of a blockchain*. A blockchain explorer is directly connected to a particular blockchain and enable users to view and query data like blocks, transactions, addresses, address history, address balance, etc.
- Blockchain explorers like *etherscan.io (for Ethereum) or bscscan.com (Binance Smart Chain)* play a crucial role in the blockchain ecosystem, since without them most users won’t be able to view and query blockchain data.
- Blockchain explorers are mostly used by users to check address balance, transaction history, or transaction confirmation. However blockchain explorers provide data about network statistics, block information, token and contract information, and many more.



## Transaction Fee / Gas Fee
- **Similar to a bank transfer, cryptocurrency transfers also incur transaction fees that need to be paid in the blockchain’s native coin. When you transfer a certain amount of cryptocurrency from one wallet to another, you need to pay a transaction fee. This fee is not fixed and can vary depending on the level of activity on the blockchain.**
- On cryptocurrency exchanges, most transaction fees are predetermined and cannot be adjusted. However, if you are using a cryptocurrency wallet, you may have the flexibility to modify the fee.
- Transactions with higher fees are given priority in cryptocurrency networks. Therefore, some users may choose to increase the fee if they need their transaction to be processed promptly.
- *In Ethereum, for example, **transaction fees are measured in gas**, which is a small fraction of ETH (Ethereum’s native cryptocurrency). The gas price represents the amount of ETH (measured in gwei) that needs to be paid to miners for processing transactions. **One gwei is equivalent to 0.000000001 or 10–9 ETH**.*
- Transaction fees are calculated based on the gas value at the time of the transaction. There are two components associated with it:
  1. Gas limit
  2. Gas price.
  The gas limit protects against unintended expenses and prevents the network from becoming too congested. The transaction fee (TX) is determined by multiplying the gas limit with the gas price.
- These fees are utilized to compensate network validators or miners for their contribution to maintaining the consensus of the blockchain network. This ensures the sustainability of the network.


## How to Reverse a Cryptocurrency Transaction
- Once a cryptocurrency transaction is verified, it becomes immutable and cannot be altered or reversed. It is impossible to cancel, modify, or undo a transaction once it has been recorded and confirmed.
- When a transaction occurs, it is verified and secured by network participants, often referred to as validators or miners. They validate the transaction data and ensure its accuracy.


## Transfer Tokens between two addresses
- *Transferring tokens is a straightforward process, similar to a regular bank transfer. You only need to input or copy the recipient’s wallet address and the amount you wish to send. Just ensure that you have sufficient funds in the network’s native utility coin to cover the transaction fee*.
- There are two primary locations from which you can send tokens: a wallet offered by a **Centralized Exchange (CEX) such as Binance or Coinbase**, or a *self-custodial wallet*, which can be a **software wallet like MetaMask or a hardware wallet like Trezor**.
- Remember these points when sending crypto:
  1. Once a cryptocurrency transaction is verified, it becomes immutable and cannot be altered or reversed. It is impossible to cancel, modify, or undo a transaction once it has been recorded and confirmed.
  2. Similar to a bank transfer, cryptocurrency transfers also incur transaction fees that need to be paid in the blockchain’s native coin.
  3. It’s important to ensure that you send the corresponding cryptocurrency to the correct address. For instance, send Bitcoin to a Bitcoin address and Ethereum to an Ethereum address. Each type of cryptocurrency has its own specific address.
  4. After your transaction has been validated and approved, the cryptocurrency will be visible in the recipient’s account. This confirmation process can take a few seconds to a few minutes.



## Tansaction Time
- *Transactions per second (TPS) represents the ability of a blockchain to manage a specific quantity of transactions in a single second. The time it takes for a transaction to be recorded on the blockchain depends on the network and the transaction fee paid. A transaction example on the Ethereum network can take anywhere from 15 seconds to 15 minutes*.
- A transaction can be instant, or it might take a few minutes to go through. In busy periods, it could even take even an hour.
- *Bitcoin transactions typically require approximately 10 to 30 minutes to be fully completed*. Sometimes, you may have to wait for hours before a transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain is completed. Each time a new transaction is verified and added to a new block, it counts as one confirmation. After an average of 10 minutes, another block will include that transaction, making it two confirmations. Some services require only one confirmation, while others, like exchanges, may require 3 or more confirmations for Bitcoin (BTC) transactions.


## How to know if a Transaction was Successful?
- You have various options to monitor and see how your transactions are progressing. You can use tools such as a **full node, a wallet, or websites called blockchain explorers**. These tools help you keep an eye on the status and progress of your transactions.
- If you want to be sure of the success of a particular transaction, you can copy-paste the transaction ID (TXID) to the specific blockchain explorer to see its status.
- If you don’t have your TXID, you can copy-paste your wallet address to the particular blockchain explorer and search for the transaction in the ‘Transactions’ or ‘Token Transfers’ tab.


## How to check Transaction History?
- *Block explorers act as gateways for accessing and reading all the transactions recorded on a blockchain. They allow you to view the balance of each address and access detailed information about each transaction.*

-> **How to check cryptocurrency transaction history on a Centralized Exchange (CEX):** Each CEX provides you with a transaction history for deposits, trades, and withdrawals.

-> **How to check cryptocurrency transaction history on the blockchain:**
- You can review your wallet address transaction history in your self-custodial wallet like MetaMask, or you can utilize a blockchain explorer.
- By simply copying and pasting your wallet address into the specific blockchain explorer, you can view your transactions for each address. If you have ERC-20 tokens (tokens on the Ethereum network), you should use etherscan.io. If you have BEP-20 tokens (tokens on the Binance Smart Chain), you should use bscscan.com to view your balance.
- To view the transaction history of a specific address, use the ‘Transactions,’ ‘Internal Transactions,’ ‘Token transfers,’ or ‘NFT Transfers’ tabs on the blockchain explorer.

                                                    # Consensus Algorithm
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Consensus Algorithm
- **A consensus algorithm, also known as consensus mechanism or consensus protocol is a set of rules in the blockchain to achieve agreement in the decentralized network among participants on the validity of blocks, transactions and the order in which they are added to the blockchain. Consensus algorithms play a crucial role in ensuring the integrity and security of the blockchain.**
- A consensus algorithm ensures that everyone agrees on decisions while using as few resources as possible. This keeps the system honest and transparent. It lays out the conditions that nodes and validators must meet in order to add new blocks to the blockchain.
- The first consensus mechanism, called **Proof-of-Work (PoW)**, was created for the Bitcoin blockchain. Bitcoin inspired developers to explore blockchain technology further, leading to the emergence of new consensus mechanisms. Each consensus mechanism focuses on a specific requirement, such as *work, stake, or authority*, to ensure agreement and validate transactions and blocks.
- Consensus mechanisms are crucial for the proper functioning of any blockchain system. They make sure that all nodes work together and follow the same rules. Additionally, they provide security for blockchain users.
- For a transaction to be successfully recorded on the ledger and added to a block, consensus must be reached among all nodes. The responsibility is shared among node operators, ensuring that the consensus mechanism continues to work even if some nodes fail to perform their tasks.


## Blockchain Trilemma
- **The idea of the blockchain trilemma, introduced by *Vitalik Buterin(Ethereum Founder)*, highlights three main obstacles that developers face when constructing blockchains: decentralization, security, and scalability. They often have to make trade-offs by sacrificing one aspect to accommodate the other two.**
- *Typically, decentralized networks can only prioritize two out of the three benefits at any given time*. These benefits include ***decentralization***, which ensures that control over the network is evenly distributed among participants; ***security***, which involves robust defenses against malicious entities; and ***scalability***, which pertains to the capacity of managing a high volume of transactions and users without compromising transaction times and fees.
- Fortunately, ongoing innovation within the decentralized ecosystem has led to various Layer-1 and Layer-2 solutions that are overcoming these obstacles and aiming to solve the trilemma once and for all. *Developers are exploring different consensus mechanisms and scalability solutions like sharding, sidechains, and state channels*.
- The blockchain trilemma acknowledges the challenge of attaining ideal levels of all three properties at the same time. When one aspect is increased, another is often weakened. This poses a difficulty in scaling blockchains while upholding both decentralization and security.



## Types of Consensus Algorithm
Blockchain technology utilizes various methods, called consensus algorithms, to achieve agreement in the decentralized network among participants. Each consensus mechanism focuses on a specific requirement, such as work, stake, or authority, to ensure agreement and validate transactions and blocks. In addition to the two most widely used and known PoW and PoS consensus algorithms, more and more new consensus mechanisms are appearing on the market, which try to overcome the limitations of the older consensus protocols.

1. ***Proof of Work (PoW):***
   - This algorithm is known for its high demand for computing power and is often seen as inefficient, however it is considered as the most decentralized one.
   - Miners utilize their computational power to solve complex mathematical problems, which aids in the verification of transactions and the creation of new blocks in the blockchain.
2. ***Proof of Stake:***
   - Instead of relying on computational power, PoS involves staking coins in a wallet or a smart contract.
   - Nodes that have staked their coins have a say in achieving consensus. This method is often considered less decentralized compared to PoW.
   - Ethereum is shifting from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake to increase energy efficiency. Those have more then 32 ETH can do Mining.
3. ***Delegated-Proof-of-Stake (DPoS):*** DPoS is similar to PoS but with a different approach. It is not completely decentralized. Stakers don’t directly validate blocks; instead, they choose delegates who handle the transaction validation.
4. ***Proof-of-Authority (PoA):*** PoA is used in entirely centralized systems. Pre-approved accounts chosen by system administrators perform the validations across the network. It is frequently employed in private blockchains.
5. ***Proof-of-Randomness (PoR):*** QANplatform developed a new consensus algorithm that consumes considerably less energy and yet remains democratic. QANplatform leverages the Proof-of-Randomness (PoR) consensus protocol which possesses inherent verifiable pseudorandomness. As a result of its streamlined consensus protocol, there is no need for complex mathematical computations that require large amounts of energy.

There are several other consensus algorithms like Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT), Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG), Proof-of-Capacity (PoC), Proof-of-Burn (PoB), Proof-of-Elapsed-Time (PoET), and many more.

## Encrytion

#### 1. Introduction to Encryption 
- In cryptography, ***encryption*** is the process of encoding information. This process converts the original representation of the information, known as ***plaintext***, into an alternative form known as ***ciphertext***.
- Ideally, only authorized parties can decipher a ciphertext back to plaintext and access the original information. Encryption does not itself prevent interference but denies the intelligible content to a would-be interceptor.
- For technical reasons, an encryption scheme usually uses a ***pseudo-random encryption key*** generated by an algorithm.
- **It is possible to decrypt the message without possessing the key but, for a well-designed encryption scheme, considerable computational resources and skills are required**. An authorized recipient can easily decrypt the message with the key provided by the originator to recipients but not to unauthorized users.
- Modern encryption schemes use the concepts of ***public-key*** and ***symmetric-key***. Modern encryption techniques ensure security because *modern computers are inefficient at cracking the encryption.*


#### 2. History of Encrytion technology
- One of the most famous military encryption developments was the **Caesar Cipher**, which was a system in which a letter in normal text is shifted down a fixed number of positions down the alphabet to get the encoded letter. A message encoded with this type of encryption could be decoded with the fixed number on the Caesar Cipher
- Around 1790, **Thomas Jefferson theorized a cipher to encode and decode messages** in order to provide a more secure way of military correspondence. The cipher, known today as the Wheel Cipher or the Jefferson Disk, although never actually built, was theorized as a spool that could jumble an English message up to 36 characters. The message could be decrypted by plugging in the jumbled message to a receiver with an identical cipher
- A similar device to the Jefferson Disk, the **M-94**, was developed in 1917 independently by US Army Major Joseph Mauborne. This device was used in U.S. military communications until 1942.
- n World War II, the Axis powers used a more advanced version of the M-94 called the Enigma Machine. The Enigma Machine was more complex because unlike the Jefferson Wheel and the M-94, each day the jumble of letters switched to a completely new combination.


#### 3. Types of Encryption in Cryptography
###### 1. Symmetric Key
In symmetric-key schemes, the ***encryption and decryption keys are the same***. Communicating parties must have the same key in order to achieve secure communication. The German Enigma Machine utilized a new symmetric-key each day for encoding and decoding messages.
![image](https://github.com/Sourabh-Kumar04/Blockchain-concepts/assets/155216316/deaf489b-0b80-469e-88bd-0da7b0d02a8c)


###### 2. Asymmetric Key (Public Key)
- In public-key encryption schemes, the encryption key is published for anyone to use and encrypt messages. However, only the receiving party has access to the decryption key that enables messages to be read.
- Public-key encryption was first described in a secret document in 1973; beforehand, all encryption schemes were symmetric-key (also called private-key). Although published subsequently, the work of Diffie and Hellman was published in a journal with a large readership, and the value of the methodology was explicitly described. The method became known as the Diffie-Hellman key exchange.


###### 3. RSA (Rivert-Shamir_Adleman)
RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is another notable public-key cryptosystem. Created in 1978, it is still used today for applications involving digital signatures. Using number theory, the RSA algorithm selects two prime numbers, which help generate both the encryption and decryption keys
![image](https://github.com/Sourabh-Kumar04/Blockchain-concepts/assets/155216316/fce76994-7b97-4e7a-9bc6-b20874715f35)


###### 4. Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)
A publicly available public-key encryption application called Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) was written in 1991 by Phil Zimmermann, and distributed free of charge with source code. PGP was purchased by Symantec in 2010 and is regularly updated.


 

#### 4. Data Erasure
- Conventional methods for permanently deleting data from a storage device involve overwriting the device's whole content with zeros, ones, or other patterns – a process which can take a significant amount of time, depending on the capacity and the type of storage medium.
- Cryptography offers a way of making the erasure almost instantaneous. This method is called ***crypto-shredding***.
- An example implementation of this method can be found on iOS devices, where the cryptographic key is kept in a dedicated 'effaceable storage'.Because the key is stored on the same device, this setup on its own does not offer full privacy or security protection if an unauthorized person gains physical access to the device.



#### 5. Limitation of Encryption
- The ***length of the encryption key is an indicator of the strength of the encryption method***.
- For example, the original encryption key, **DES (Data Encryption Standard), was 56 bits**, meaning it had 2^56 combination possibilities. With today's computing power, a 56-bit key is no longer secure, being vulnerable to brute force attacks.
- **Quantum computing** utilizes properties of quantum mechanics in order to process large amounts of data simultaneously. Quantum computing has been found to achieve computing speeds thousands of times faster than today's supercomputers.
- This computing power presents a challenge to today's encryption technology. For example, RSA encryption utilizes the multiplication of very large prime numbers to create a semiprime number for its public key.
- Decoding this key without its private key requires this semiprime number to be factored, which can take a very long time to do with modern computers. It would take a supercomputer anywhere between weeks to months to factor in this key.
- However, quantum computing can use quantum algorithms to factor this semiprime number in the same amount of time it takes for normal computers to generate it. This would make all data protected by current public-key encryption vulnerable to quantum computing attacks.
- Other encryption techniques like elliptic curve cryptography and symmetric key encryption are also vulnerable to quantum computing.
- While quantum computing could be a threat to encryption security in the future, quantum computing as it currently stands is still very limited.
- Quantum computing advancements will be able to be utilized in favor of encryption as well. The National Security Agency (NSA) is currently preparing post-quantum encryption standards for the future.
- Quantum encryption promises a level of security that will be able to counter the threat of quantum computing.
- Most applications of **encryption protect information only at rest or in transit, leaving sensitive data in clear text and potentially vulnerable to improper disclosure during processing, such as by a cloud service for example**.
- **Homomorphic encryption** and **secure multi-party computation** are emerging techniques to compute on encrypted data; these techniques are general and Turing complete but incur high computational and/or communication costs.
