## What Exactly is Blockchain?
- Blockchain is a **tamper-proof distributed digital ledger**.
- This digital ledger is safe, secure, transparent, and decentralized, which simply means that it is not controlled by a single authority.
- It is like a ledger that a bank uses to keep track of all customer transactions. However, in a bank, the ledger is controlled by the bank, and only the bank can see the transactions.
- Whereas in blockchain, there is no central authority, and the ledger runs on multiple computers and doesn’t require any single person to authenticate or settle transactions.
- Blockchain is an unchangeable digital ledger that is collectively shared, enabling the seamless recording of transactions and monitoring of assets within a network.
- Assets can encompass both **tangible items** like houses, cars, cash, and land, as well as **intangible entities** such as intellectual property, patents, copyrights, and branding.
- Virtually any valuable item can be traced and exchanged on a blockchain network, leading to decreased risks and reduced expenses for all participants involved.



## What is a blockchain node?
Blockchains consist of a group of computers known as nodes. These nodes work together to synchronize the blockchain’s data, handle transaction requests, and reach consensus on the validity of those transactions.

#### Typea of Blockchian Nodes?







## What is a Block?
- With each data transaction taking place, it is documented and stored as a data block. These blocks form a chain of data.
- Blocks are arranged in a specific order, with new blocks added at the end of the chain.
- Each block includes a ***unique identifier called a hash***, which references the previous block. This is an important security feature of blockchain technology that makes it incredibly difficult to tamper with the ledger.
- In addition to important information like the time of the transaction and the record itself, every block contains the solution to a special puzzle that requires computational power to solve.

#### Types of Block
**1. Genesis Block-->** The very first block is the genesis block. Unlike other blocks, it doesn’t have a reference to a previous block because it marks the beginning of the chain.

**2. -->**
**3. -->**




## Structure of Blockchain




## What is Smart Contract?
- Smart contracts are **computer programs** that automatically carry out predefined parameters.
- The terms are coded directly into the program’s lines. This program is stored on a decentralized blockchain network.
- When specific conditions outlined in the code are met, the smart contract is executed automatically. Once the code is run, it cannot be undone or modified.
- Smart contracts offer a major benefit by allowing transactions and agreements to happen between parties who may not fully trust each other. This means that there’s no need for a third-party authority, legal system, or external mechanism to oversee the process. It allows for anonymous execution of agreements.






## What is a Decentralised Application(dApp)?
Smart contracts, or also called as Decentralized Applications (DApps) are applications that operate on a distributed computing system, specifically a blockchain network, rather than relying on a single server.
- When defining a DApp, they are typically characterized by being Open Source, Decentralized, and Cryptographically secure.
- DApps consist of two important components: the **frontend and the backend**.
- **The frontend is responsible for user interaction, while the backend is essentially a smart contract.**

#### Advantage of DApps
The main advantage of choosing a DApp over a traditional app is that traditional apps use a centralized architecture, where data is stored on servers controlled by a single entity. This centralized setup has a single point of failure, making it vulnerable to technical issues and malicious attacks. On the other hand, DApps offer similar quality of service as regular apps while benefiting from decentralization, including high uptime and resistance to censorship and corruption.

#### Types of DApps (Decentralised Application)

##### 1. DeFi (Decentralised Finance)





####  Who are the key Stakeholders of a Blockchain?
The different parts of a blockchain can be categorized into distinct layers, with each layer involving various stakeholders.
1. **Protocol Layer -->** At the protocol layer, we have Developers, Researchers, and academia.
   - Developers have the task of designing and improving blockchain protocols, designing the architecture of blockchain systems, and possessing expertise in data structures and cryptography.
   - Researchers play a crucial role in educating others about blockchain technology’s impact and exploring its wide-ranging applications in business and society.
  
3. **Networking Layer -->** The networking layer involves stakeholders like Miners, Validatos, Industry bodies, and Traders.
   - Miners contribute to public blockchains like Bitcoin by building consensus among untrusted nodes. They add transactions to the network by solving complex mathematical problems, requiring substantial computing power and electricity.
   - Industry bodies act as intermediaries between researchers, private entities, and public institutions, advocating for blockchain technology and establishing standards.
   - Traders are entities that rely on cryptocurrencies rather than traditional fiat currency, allowing others access to blockchain protocols through cryptocurrency tokens.

3. ** Application Layer -->** The application layer encompasses entrepreneurs, end-users, corporations, and venture capitalists or investors.
   - *Entrepreneurs* develop applications, products, or services that make use of blockchain protocols and networks. While profitability is a common goal for entrepreneurs, those in the blockchain space often have an anti-establishment approach and a lack of trust in traditional systems.
   - *End-users* are individuals who utilize blockchain applications, products, or services, and their preferences greatly influence the decision-making of other stakeholders.
   - *Corporations* aim to solve business problems and develop new strategies using blockchain technology, recognizing its value in areas like trust, transparency, data security, sustainability, and ethical sourcing.
   - *Venture capitalists or investors* provide capital to establish the blockchain infrastructure. They have opportunities to invest in blockchain protocols directly or support companies that provide essential services and infrastructure for the blockchain ecosystem


## Use Case of Blockchain
- In addition to its growing adoption in established industries such as Government and Public Sector, Manufacturing, Supply Chain, or Healthcare, blockchain technology has also given rise to several new industries and use cases. 
- These include cryptocurrency, NFT (Non-fungible token), DeFi (Decentralized Finance), DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), and the Metaverse.



## What is a Private Blockchain?
- A private blockchain or permissioned blockchain is a type of blockchain or distributed ledger that operates within a closed network controlled by a single entity or a closed group.
- A private blockchain restricts access to only authorized participants. This means that new participants must go through a verification process to join the network, and the participation in the consensus process is limited to certain individuals.
- Private blockchains are typically used within the internal network of an enterprise. They are designed for the specific needs of the organization and rely on trust among the employees or partners within that organization. Unlike public blockchains that are decentralized, a private blockchain is centralized because it is controlled by a single entity or a closed group.


## What is a Public Blockchain?
- A public blockchain, also referred to as permissionless blockchain, is a global and open network that operates in a decentralized manner. It allows anyone to participate in transactions, contribute to the consensus protocol, and review the contents of the blockchain.
- One major benefit of a public blockchain is its **transparency**. Since anyone can join the network, it offers greater visibility into transactions and operations compared to private networks.
- It is also **more decentralized** because no single entity has complete control over the entire system. This decentralization helps ensure the integrity and security of the blockchain.
- Public blockchains can face challenges in terms of **transaction speeds and scalability**. Due to their openness and the involvement of a large number of participants, **processing transactions can take longer, and the network may struggle to handle a high volume of transactions**.
- Despite these challenges, **public blockchains are resistant to censorship and external interference**. Because there is **no single point of failure or control**, it becomes difficult for any individual or entity to manipulate or disrupt the blockchain. This attribute enhances the trustworthiness and reliability of the system.


## What is a Hybrid Blockchain?
- A hybrid blockchain is a special type of blockchain that combines features from both public and private blockchains. It brings together the best of the two blockchain types to form a unique system.
- Most blockchains are either public or private. There is currently a lack of hybrid blockchain solutions, which is a must for facilitating enterprise mass adoption.
- In a hybrid blockchain, enterprises can decide which data (transaction) shall be posted from private blockchain to public blockchain. This flexibility allows them to control who can access specific data on the blockchain and decide which data should be made public.



## Layer-1 Blockchain
- A Layer-1 blockchain platform is the **basic infrastructure of all blockchain projects and applications**. It is like the operating system on a computer. The **whole ecosystem can only build and work on top of it**.
- A Layer-1 blockchain is the **fundamental building block of a blockchain network**. It serves as the underlying protocol that forms the basis of the entire system. The primary purpose is to **securely record transactions** on a public ledger that cannot be modified or tampered with.
- Layer-1 blockchains are considered the most basic form of blockchain technology. They are often called the **“core”** or **“foundation”** of the network because they **provide the necessary infrastructure for other applications and protocols to operate**. They play a crucial role in maintaining the distributed ledger, validating transactions, and protecting the network from any harmful activities.
- In simpler terms, a Layer-1 blockchain is like the solid ground on which the entire blockchain network stands. It ensures that transactions are recorded accurately and securely, allowing other layers and applications to function effectively on top of it.


## Layer-2 Blockchain
- In simpler terms, Layer-2 networks are like an **extra layer built on top of an existing blockchain system**. They help increase transaction speed and capacity without needing to make significant changes to the main blockchain. The result is a more efficient and scalable blockchain network overall.
- A Layer-2 network is a secondary protocol that is built on an existing Layer-1 blockchain system. **Its main purpose is to enhance the scalability of the underlying blockchain by handling a large number of transactions quickly**.
- Popular blockchains like Ethereum have become increasingly popular due to their programmability and resistance to censorship, which allows for a wide range of products and use cases to be developed on them. However, Ethereum can only process a limited number of transactions per second, leading to congestion and high transaction fees.
- Layer-2 protocols serve as a solution to this problem by creating an additional framework where transactions and processes can occur independently from the main blockchain. These protocols are often referred to as ***“off-chain”*** scaling solutions. They offer several benefits, including increased transaction throughput and reduced costs.
- By offloading a significant portion of the workload to the second layer, the main chain can focus on providing security while the second layer achieves high transaction speeds. This means that hundreds or even thousands of transactions per second can be processed without compromising the network’s security.



## Blockchain Wallet
- A blockchain wallet represents a vital tool in the realm of cryptocurrency, **serving as a secure and anonymous digital wallet** that empowers users to effectively manage diverse forms of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, or QANX.
- Its core purpose lies in **facilitating seamless fund exchanges**, ensuring both convenience and security. The **cryptographic signatures employed in transactions guarantee the integrity and protection of each transaction**. Accessible via web devices, including mobile platforms, this wallet upholds user privacy and identity confidentiality. By encompassing these essential features, a blockchain wallet establishes a robust framework for executing secure and trustworthy transfers and exchanges of funds among various parties.
- The blockchain wallet itself can manifest in different forms, including internet-connected **“hot wallets” like MetaMask**, or **offline “airgapped”** hardware wallets.
- From a technical standpoint, it is pertinent to view the wallet as the client responsible for managing the functionality, as opposed to being solely reliant on storing cryptographic keys.
- In common practice, individuals frequently employ the term “wallet” to encompass their overall cryptocurrency portfolio, the associated accounts derived from it, or even an individual account.


## Security of your Blockchain Wallet
- By adhering to simple yet effective best practices, you can elevate the security of your crypto wallet and fortify the protection of your holdings. Some recommended measures include safeguarding your seed phrase, opting for cold wallets, utilizing multiple addresses, and exercising caution when dealing with tokens received through airdrops.
- It is crucial to ensure the secure setup of your wallet.
- Activating two-factor authentication (2FA) to your exchange account adds always an extra layer of protection.
- By setting up your self-custodial wallet you can mitigate the risk of future hacks by using a freshly installed computer which was never connected to the internet before.
- It is advisable to set up a **hardware wallet**. Hardware wallets are physical devices designed explicitly for storing cryptocurrencies securely offline. They are considered the most reliable type of crypto wallet.
- It is recommended to use a unique and strong password specifically for your wallet to enhance security. When using a browser-extension wallet such as **MetaMask wallet**, it is important to note that the wallet may prompt you for your password frequently.
- Accessing a wallet necessitates the provision of a unique and confidential 12-24-word seed phrase. The loss of this seed phrase results in the irretrievable loss of wallet access and the inability to recover your assets.
- Your password and seed phrase remains unknown to any other individual, as anyone possessing it can gain unrestricted access to and control over your assets. Never share your seed phrase or your private keys with anyone!.
- It is essential to exercise caution and refrain from engaging with randomly received tokens in your wallet address.



## Address
- ***A wallet address, which is also called as crypto address or blockchain address is a special combination of characters that acts as a representation of a wallet used to receive, store, send cryptocurrency. It’s like a real-life address, bank account, or an email address.***
- Bitcoin addresses mostly start with a “1” or “3” and are typically 26–35 alphanumeric characters long. Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain addresses start with “0x,” followed by a string of 40 hexadecimal characters.
- Addresses are created using a private key, which is also unique to the address. The digital assets held by the address can be accessed with the private key. Never share your private key with anyone!
- Blockchain addresses are public and often called “public keys”. By using a blockchain explorer, you have the ability to observe the transactions linked to an address and check the number of assets it holds.
- The person who owns an address usually doesn’t have their real name connected to it, and setting up a new wallet address on the blockchain doesn’t require any personally identifiable information.


## Public and Private Keys
- ***Public-key cryptography relies on two essential components: public keys and private keys, which function as its operational elements. Jointly, they facilitate the encryption and decryption processes for data circulating within a network. While the public key is openly accessible and can be distributed without limitations, it is crucial to safeguard the private key, ensuring exclusive knowledge limited to its rightful owner.***
- A public key is a unique combination of letters and numbers used to encrypt messages into a secure form called **ciphertext**. It enables peer-to-peer **transactions without revealing private key details**, ensuring a safe exchange of assets and information without involving a third party.
- When engaging in a transaction, a user shares their public key with the other party. They can make this key public for everyone to see.

## Encrytion

#### 1. Introduction to Encryption 
- In cryptography, ***encryption*** is the process of encoding information. This process converts the original representation of the information, known as ***plaintext***, into an alternative form known as ***ciphertext***.
- Ideally, only authorized parties can decipher a ciphertext back to plaintext and access the original information. Encryption does not itself prevent interference but denies the intelligible content to a would-be interceptor.
- For technical reasons, an encryption scheme usually uses a ***pseudo-random encryption key*** generated by an algorithm.
- **It is possible to decrypt the message without possessing the key but, for a well-designed encryption scheme, considerable computational resources and skills are required**. An authorized recipient can easily decrypt the message with the key provided by the originator to recipients but not to unauthorized users.
- Modern encryption schemes use the concepts of ***public-key*** and ***symmetric-key***. Modern encryption techniques ensure security because *modern computers are inefficient at cracking the encryption.*


#### 2. History of Encrytion technology
- One of the most famous military encryption developments was the **Caesar Cipher**, which was a system in which a letter in normal text is shifted down a fixed number of positions down the alphabet to get the encoded letter. A message encoded with this type of encryption could be decoded with the fixed number on the Caesar Cipher
- Around 1790, **Thomas Jefferson theorized a cipher to encode and decode messages** in order to provide a more secure way of military correspondence. The cipher, known today as the Wheel Cipher or the Jefferson Disk, although never actually built, was theorized as a spool that could jumble an English message up to 36 characters. The message could be decrypted by plugging in the jumbled message to a receiver with an identical cipher
- A similar device to the Jefferson Disk, the **M-94**, was developed in 1917 independently by US Army Major Joseph Mauborne. This device was used in U.S. military communications until 1942.
- n World War II, the Axis powers used a more advanced version of the M-94 called the Enigma Machine. The Enigma Machine was more complex because unlike the Jefferson Wheel and the M-94, each day the jumble of letters switched to a completely new combination.


#### 3. Types of Encryption in Cryptography
###### 1. Symmetric Key
In symmetric-key schemes, the ***encryption and decryption keys are the same***. Communicating parties must have the same key in order to achieve secure communication. The German Enigma Machine utilized a new symmetric-key each day for encoding and decoding messages.

###### 2. Asymmetric Key (Public Key)
- In public-key encryption schemes, the encryption key is published for anyone to use and encrypt messages. However, only the receiving party has access to the decryption key that enables messages to be read.
- Public-key encryption was first described in a secret document in 1973; beforehand, all encryption schemes were symmetric-key (also called private-key). Although published subsequently, the work of Diffie and Hellman was published in a journal with a large readership, and the value of the methodology was explicitly described. The method became known as the Diffie-Hellman key exchange.


###### 3. RSA (Rivert-Shamir_Adleman)
RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is another notable public-key cryptosystem. Created in 1978, it is still used today for applications involving digital signatures. Using number theory, the RSA algorithm selects two prime numbers, which help generate both the encryption and decryption keys

###### 4. Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)
A publicly available public-key encryption application called Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) was written in 1991 by Phil Zimmermann, and distributed free of charge with source code. PGP was purchased by Symantec in 2010 and is regularly updated.


 

#### 4. Data Erasure
- Conventional methods for permanently deleting data from a storage device involve overwriting the device's whole content with zeros, ones, or other patterns – a process which can take a significant amount of time, depending on the capacity and the type of storage medium.
- Cryptography offers a way of making the erasure almost instantaneous. This method is called ***crypto-shredding***.
- An example implementation of this method can be found on iOS devices, where the cryptographic key is kept in a dedicated 'effaceable storage'.Because the key is stored on the same device, this setup on its own does not offer full privacy or security protection if an unauthorized person gains physical access to the device.



#### 5. Limitation of Encryption
- The ***length of the encryption key is an indicator of the strength of the encryption method***.
- For example, the original encryption key, **DES (Data Encryption Standard), was 56 bits**, meaning it had 2^56 combination possibilities. With today's computing power, a 56-bit key is no longer secure, being vulnerable to brute force attacks.
- **Quantum computing** utilizes properties of quantum mechanics in order to process large amounts of data simultaneously. Quantum computing has been found to achieve computing speeds thousands of times faster than today's supercomputers.
- This computing power presents a challenge to today's encryption technology. For example, RSA encryption utilizes the multiplication of very large prime numbers to create a semiprime number for its public key.
- Decoding this key without its private key requires this semiprime number to be factored, which can take a very long time to do with modern computers. It would take a supercomputer anywhere between weeks to months to factor in this key.
- However, quantum computing can use quantum algorithms to factor this semiprime number in the same amount of time it takes for normal computers to generate it. This would make all data protected by current public-key encryption vulnerable to quantum computing attacks.
- Other encryption techniques like elliptic curve cryptography and symmetric key encryption are also vulnerable to quantum computing.
- While quantum computing could be a threat to encryption security in the future, quantum computing as it currently stands is still very limited.
- Quantum computing advancements will be able to be utilized in favor of encryption as well. The National Security Agency (NSA) is currently preparing post-quantum encryption standards for the future.
- Quantum encryption promises a level of security that will be able to counter the threat of quantum computing.
- Most applications of **encryption protect information only at rest or in transit, leaving sensitive data in clear text and potentially vulnerable to improper disclosure during processing, such as by a cloud service for example**.
- **Homomorphic encryption** and **secure multi-party computation** are emerging techniques to compute on encrypted data; these techniques are general and Turing complete but incur high computational and/or communication costs.
