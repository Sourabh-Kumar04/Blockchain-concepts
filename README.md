## What Exactly is Blockchain?
#### What is Blockchain?
- Blockchain is a **tamper-proof distributed digital ledger**.
- This digital ledger is safe, secure, transparent, and decentralized, which simply means that it is not controlled by a single authority.
- It is like a ledger that a bank uses to keep track of all customer transactions. However, in a bank, the ledger is controlled by the bank, and only the bank can see the transactions.
- Whereas in blockchain, there is no central authority, and the ledger runs on multiple computers and doesn’t require any single person to authenticate or settle transactions.
- Blockchain is an unchangeable digital ledger that is collectively shared, enabling the seamless recording of transactions and monitoring of assets within a network.
- Assets can encompass both **tangible items** like houses, cars, cash, and land, as well as **intangible entities** such as intellectual property, patents, copyrights, and branding.
- Virtually any valuable item can be traced and exchanged on a blockchain network, leading to decreased risks and reduced expenses for all participants involved.



## What is a blockchain node?
Blockchains consist of a group of computers known as nodes. These nodes work together to synchronize the blockchain’s data, handle transaction requests, and reach consensus on the validity of those transactions.

#### Typea of Blockchian Nodes?







## What is a Block?
- With each data transaction taking place, it is documented and stored as a data block. These blocks form a chain of data.
- Blocks are arranged in a specific order, with new blocks added at the end of the chain.
- Each block includes a ***unique identifier called a hash***, which references the previous block. This is an important security feature of blockchain technology that makes it incredibly difficult to tamper with the ledger.
- In addition to important information like the time of the transaction and the record itself, every block contains the solution to a special puzzle that requires computational power to solve.

#### Types of Block
**1. Genesis Block-->** The very first block is the genesis block. Unlike other blocks, it doesn’t have a reference to a previous block because it marks the beginning of the chain.

**2. -->**
**3. -->**




## Structure of Blockchain




## What is Smart Contract?
- Smart contracts are **computer programs** that automatically carry out predefined parameters.
- The terms are coded directly into the program’s lines. This program is stored on a decentralized blockchain network.
- When specific conditions outlined in the code are met, the smart contract is executed automatically. Once the code is run, it cannot be undone or modified.
- Smart contracts offer a major benefit by allowing transactions and agreements to happen between parties who may not fully trust each other. This means that there’s no need for a third-party authority, legal system, or external mechanism to oversee the process. It allows for anonymous execution of agreements.






## What is a Decentralised Application(dApp)?
Smart contracts, or also called as Decentralized Applications (DApps) are applications that operate on a distributed computing system, specifically a blockchain network, rather than relying on a single server.
- When defining a DApp, they are typically characterized by being Open Source, Decentralized, and Cryptographically secure.
- DApps consist of two important components: the **frontend and the backend**.
- **The frontend is responsible for user interaction, while the backend is essentially a smart contract.**

#### Advantage of DApps
The main advantage of choosing a DApp over a traditional app is that traditional apps use a centralized architecture, where data is stored on servers controlled by a single entity. This centralized setup has a single point of failure, making it vulnerable to technical issues and malicious attacks. On the other hand, DApps offer similar quality of service as regular apps while benefiting from decentralization, including high uptime and resistance to censorship and corruption.

#### Types of DApps (Decentralised Application)

##### 1. DeFi (Decentralised Finance)





####  Who are the key Stakeholders of a Blockchain?
The different parts of a blockchain can be categorized into distinct layers, with each layer involving various stakeholders.
1. **Protocol Layer -->** At the protocol layer, we have Developers, Researchers, and academia.
   - Developers have the task of designing and improving blockchain protocols, designing the architecture of blockchain systems, and possessing expertise in data structures and cryptography.
   - Researchers play a crucial role in educating others about blockchain technology’s impact and exploring its wide-ranging applications in business and society.
  
3. **Networking Layer -->** The networking layer involves stakeholders like Miners, Validatos, Industry bodies, and Traders.
   - Miners contribute to public blockchains like Bitcoin by building consensus among untrusted nodes. They add transactions to the network by solving complex mathematical problems, requiring substantial computing power and electricity.
   - Industry bodies act as intermediaries between researchers, private entities, and public institutions, advocating for blockchain technology and establishing standards.
   - Traders are entities that rely on cryptocurrencies rather than traditional fiat currency, allowing others access to blockchain protocols through cryptocurrency tokens.

3. ** Application Layer -->** The application layer encompasses entrepreneurs, end-users, corporations, and venture capitalists or investors.
   - *Entrepreneurs* develop applications, products, or services that make use of blockchain protocols and networks. While profitability is a common goal for entrepreneurs, those in the blockchain space often have an anti-establishment approach and a lack of trust in traditional systems.
   - *End-users* are individuals who utilize blockchain applications, products, or services, and their preferences greatly influence the decision-making of other stakeholders.
   - *Corporations* aim to solve business problems and develop new strategies using blockchain technology, recognizing its value in areas like trust, transparency, data security, sustainability, and ethical sourcing.
   - *Venture capitalists or investors* provide capital to establish the blockchain infrastructure. They have opportunities to invest in blockchain protocols directly or support companies that provide essential services and infrastructure for the blockchain ecosystem


## Use Case of Blockchain
- In addition to its growing adoption in established industries such as Government and Public Sector, Manufacturing, Supply Chain, or Healthcare, blockchain technology has also given rise to several new industries and use cases. 
- These include cryptocurrency, NFT (Non-fungible token), DeFi (Decentralized Finance), DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), and the Metaverse.



## What is a Private Blockchain?
- A private blockchain or permissioned blockchain is a type of blockchain or distributed ledger that operates within a closed network controlled by a single entity or a closed group.
- A private blockchain restricts access to only authorized participants. This means that new participants must go through a verification process to join the network, and the participation in the consensus process is limited to certain individuals.
- Private blockchains are typically used within the internal network of an enterprise. They are designed for the specific needs of the organization and rely on trust among the employees or partners within that organization. Unlike public blockchains that are decentralized, a private blockchain is centralized because it is controlled by a single entity or a closed group.
